# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

Steps in this project:
1. Analyze a dataset for sentiment analysis. 
2. Read in a PyTorch BERT model, and adjust the architecture for multi-class classification. 
3. Adjust an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance. 
4. Design a train and evaluate loop to monitor model performance as it trains, including saving and loading models. 
5. Build a Sentiment Analysis model that leverages BERT's large-scale language knowledge.
